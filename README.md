# Patriots-ProShop

# What is this?

Inspired by Patriots storefront website, I recreated the store using React.js framework and with the tools listed below.
### React.js libraries used:
  1. react-bootstrap
  2. react-media
  3. react-scroll
  4. bootswatch


# What I learned:

After building this website with React.js, I was able to put in practice a lot of the essential web development techniques that I learned from
writing vanilla JS with HTML and CSS. I felt a good sense of organizing my code using this framework as I was working with media queries and multiple JS files for each component.


# New features to add:
1. Implement product detail page, cart, and checkout page.
2. Implment search product feature.
3. Implement user account and login feature.
